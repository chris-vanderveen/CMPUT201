# CMPUT201 Coursework

This repository contains my coursework for the CMPUT201 course.

## Content

The repository is organized by assignments and each assignment has its own directory. Each directory contains the source code files, along with any additional files required for the assignment. Not all of the content in these directories were my own work. My work exists only in the files with .c filenames and will have a header comment listing myself as the Author.

## Usage

To compile and run any of the programs, navigate to the respective directory and use the GCC compiler:

```bash
gcc -o program program.c
./program
